# 6. Clustering Analysis

For all of the following files, make sure you go through the code and change any file paths to point towards the correct data

First run **AnalyzeGroupsInCondition.R** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate the raw plotting data:

- 3RatsClusterSummary.Rda
- 6RatsClusterSummary.Rda
- 9RatsClusterSummary.Rda
- 15RatsClusterSummary.Rda

Then use **PlotRealClusters.R** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate plots.
