# DLC Analysis and Reporting

To follow this repo, you should have already trained a pose estimation model in DLC, and have run the model on videos to create output csvâ€™s. Proceed in chronological order. Each step folder has more details about how to use the files provided.

## 1. Processing DLC Data

Turn the raw csv outputs of DLC inference into formatted .RData files with food drop information for further analysis.

## 2. Approaches

Calculate the approaches between rats using position data

## 3. Convert

Convert position data from csv format to Rda.

## 4. Speed Analysis

Generate formatted speed analysis data, then plot data.

## 5. Distance Analysis

Generate formatted distance analysis data, then plot data.

## 6. Clustering Analysis

Run DBSCAN clustering algorithm, format, and plot data.

## . Bootstrapping

Create bootstrapped experiment and run trials.
