# 4. Speed Analysis

For all of the following files, make sure you go through the code and change any file paths to point towards the correct data and change the condition to the right one (3, 6, 9, 15).

First run **Speed_Distance.R** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate the raw plotting data:

- 3all_speeds.Rda
- 6all_speeds.Rda
- 9all_speeds.Rda
- 15all_speeds.Rda

Here is our all_speed data: https://utexas.box.com/s/wh83k4c3giml770qwnsu1eymroxhrose

Then use **PlotSpeed_Food.R** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate plots.
