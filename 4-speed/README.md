# 4. Speed Analysis

For all of the following files, make sure you go through the code and change any file paths to point towards the correct data

First run **Speed_Distance.R** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate the raw plotting data:

- 3all_speeds.Rda
- 6all_speeds.Rda
- 9all_speeds.Rda
- 15all_speeds.Rda

Then use **PlotSpeed_Food.R** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate plots.
