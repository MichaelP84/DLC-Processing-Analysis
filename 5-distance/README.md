# 3. Distance Analysis

For all of the following files, make sure you go through the code and change any file paths to point towards the correct data

First run **x** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate the raw plotting data:

- 3all_distances.Rda
- 6all_distances.Rda
- 9all_distances.Rda
- 15all_distances.Rda

Then use **PlotDistance_Separate.R** 4 times (once for each condition) to generate plots.
